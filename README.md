<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Often, Students have to wait for their turn at the Health Care Center and it is a long process to get the leave/absence letter signed by the authorities to get attendance for classes missed due to medical reasons.

What if this can be done digitally? This is the core idea of the HCC module. The module will allow students to book appointments online based on the Doctor’s availability. Additionally, students can generate a leave/absence letter that goes through two levels of approval —first from the HCC in charge and then from the Dean of Student Welfare. The system should notify the relevant approvers when a new leave slip is awaiting approval. Once fully approved, the student will receive a confirmation with the signed leave slip.

Experience the HCC Module in action! The application is deployed and ready to use with all features available.

## Getting Started

The prerequisites and installation instructions are listed in this section

### Prerequisites

There are two ways to set up the app- either through docker (this method enables load balancing and other nginx features) or a local setup (better for development as live css reloading is enabled)

#### Docker -

1. [Install docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. [Install docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Local setup-

1. Ruby `v3.3.5`
2. Ruby on Rails `v7.2.1`
3. NPM and nodejs
4. A ruby version manager (not compulsory), preferably `rvm` or `rbenv`
 
<p align="right">(<a href="#hcc-module---iris-code-in-task">back to top</a>)</p>

### Installation


#### Using Docker-compose -

1. Clone the repo to your local pc and cd into the directory.
2. Precompile the CSS
```bash
rails assets:precompile
```
2. Enter the following command to fire up all the containers. 
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
3. Access the application at http://localhost:80

#### Local Setup -

1. Clone the repo to your local pc and cd into the directory.
2. Set the ruby version to `v3.3.5` using your version manager.
3. Install dependencies 
```bash
npm install
```
4. Install all the gems in the Gemfile
```bash
bundle install
```
5. Make the migrations
```bash
rails db:migrate
```
6. Pre Compile the CSS 
```bash
rails assets:precompile
```
7. Run the server
```bash
bin/dev
```
8. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

_**Note**: The current docker setup does not support live reloading of CSS. You need to precompile the assets (See step 2 in docker setup) and then rebuild the images and containers for the changes to be reflected. However, this is not an issue with local setup as it uses the bin/dev script_

<!-- List of non-implemented/planned features -->
## List of non-implemented/planned features

1. <strong>Improve the UI</strong> - For the task , I just created a basic frontend with daisy UI components, which has a lot of scope for improvement. Dark Mode support also can be added
2. <strong>Implement a pharmacy submodule </strong>, showing list of availble medicines, timings etc. We can further scale this up to support online ordering of medicines and then getting it delivered through changepay to hostels.
3. <strong>Implement mailer system</strong> for all functions (need to sort out issues with my gmail)
4. Add a <strong>dedicated page</strong> to view Doctor's details, specializations and emergency contact numbers.


<!-- List of known bugs -->
## List of known bugs

1. While running the app through docker/docker-compose, any tailwind classes added do not generate the correspondng CSS. We need to run the tailwind:watch script as well but that was causing some issues with my docker setup.
2. In the student appointment creation page, for the time slot select to work, the page needs to be reloaded once
